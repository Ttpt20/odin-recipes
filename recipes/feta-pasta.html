    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Did you think that the TikTok pasta recipe was a passing fad? You thought wrong! Find out how, with just a few
        ingredients, a baking pan and an oven, you can feed a family or yourself in a pinch.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pints cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>8 oz feta cheese</li>
        <li>9 oz pasta</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic crushed</li>
        <li>fresh basil chopped, to finish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F. In a baking dish, toss the tomatoes with the olive oil and place the feta in the
            middle, turning it to coat it in oil. Season everything with salt and pepper and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 30 minutes, turn the heat up to 450°F and roast until the feta is golden brown 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the feta is baking, cook the pasta according to the package directions. Save 1-2 cups of the pasta
            water, then drain well.</li>
        <li>When the feta and tomatoes are done, remove from the oven and immediately add the garlic and crushed red
            pepper, if using. Stir everything together until the tomatoes and feta combine into a creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Stir in the drained pasta until well coated and creamy, adding in a bit of pasta water to loosen if too
            thick. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Stir in some chopped basil and finish with crushed red pepper.
            Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
